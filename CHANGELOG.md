# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenClaw Aegis are documented here.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Root cause analysis engine** — correlates probe failures, log patterns, and incident events to identify why failures happen
  - 10 failure signatures: OOM kill, port conflict, config corruption, network failure, disk exhaustion, CPU saturation, channel disconnect, process crash, WebSocket failure, cascading failure
  - Confidence scoring based on required probe matches, optional probe correlation, and log pattern evidence
  - Per-incident analysis: `GET /rca/:incidentId` for post-mortem investigation
  - Live analysis: `GET /rca` for current state root cause identification
  - Actionable suggestions for each identified root cause
  - Auto-runs during escalation, results logged to incident timeline
- 2 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /rca` — live root cause analysis
  - `GET /rca/:incidentId` — root cause analysis for specific incident
- Total API endpoints: 31 (was 29)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Predictive alerts** — trend analysis engine that projects when thresholds will be breached
  - Memory exhaustion: projects when memory probe score will reach critical based on declining trend
  - Disk full: projects when disk probe score will hit zero based on fill rate
  - Score degradation: projects when aggregate health score will drop below HEALTHY threshold
  - Latency breach: projects when probe latency will exceed timeout for HTTP, port, WebSocket probes
  - Linear regression with R² confidence scoring
  - Configurable warning horizon (default: 1h), runs every 10th health check to save CPU
- New config section: `[intelligence.predictive]` with 5 tunable parameters
- 1 new API endpoint:
  - `GET /predictions` — current predictions with estimated time-to-threshold
- Total API endpoints: 29 (was 28)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Anomaly detection engine** — learns baseline health patterns and alerts on statistical deviations
  - Score anomaly: detects when aggregate health score drops below baseline (configurable σ threshold)
  - Latency anomaly: detects per-probe latency spikes beyond normal variance
  - Failure rate anomaly: detects sudden probe failure rate increases vs historical baseline
  - Requires confirmation (default 3 consecutive detections) before alerting to avoid false positives
  - Alert cooldown (default 15 min) prevents notification spam
  - Feeds from existing health history time-series data
- New config section: `[intelligence.anomaly]` with 7 tunable parameters
- 2 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /anomalies` — currently detected anomalies
  - `GET /anomalies/baselines` — computed baselines for score and all probes
- Total API endpoints: 28 (was 26)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Interactive `/repair` bot command** — two-step confirmation flow for on-demand L3 deep repair
  - `/repair` shows a warning listing all 5 destructive L3 strategies and their impact
  - `/repair confirm` executes L3 deep repair and returns per-action results
  - Works even when `l3Enabled = false` in config — gives users manual control when automated L3 is disabled
- New public `triggerL3()` method on `RecoveryOrchestrator` for programmatic L3 invocation

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **L3 deep repair is now disabled by default** (`l3Enabled = false`) — L3 strategies (network repair, process resurrection, dependency rebuild, safe mode boot, disk cleanup) are destructive and can affect other services on the server
- When L3 is disabled and recovery reaches L4, the alert message explicitly tells you L3 is disabled and how to enable it (`l3Enabled = true` in `[recovery]` config)
- New recovery event: `L3_DISABLED` — emitted when L3 would have run but is turned off

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Channel readiness probe** — 11th health probe that checks all configured messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) are actually connected and ready to deliver messages via `openclaw channels status --json`
  - Score 2: all channels ready
  - Score 1: some channels degraded (running but not connected)
  - Score 0: no channels running or command failed
- Detects WhatsApp Web listener disconnections, Telegram bot failures, and startup gaps where channels aren't ready yet

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** — exposes health scores, probe results, recovery counts, circuit breaker state, alert stats, MTTR, and process memory in Prometheus text exposition format
- **Structured JSON logging** — JSONL format logs compatible with Loki, ELK, Datadog. Configurable log level, file output, and stdout toggle
- **Health history time-series** — stores every health check result over time (default: 24 hours at 10s intervals). Query by time range or count, compute trend statistics
- **SLA tracking and uptime reports** — calculates uptime percentages, time in each health band, incident counts, and MTTR for any time period (1h/24h/7d/30d presets)
- **Recovery tracing** — records structured spans for every recovery step with timing, compatible with OpenTelemetry JSON format for import into Jaeger/Tempo
- 8 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /metrics` — Prometheus scrape target
  - `GET /health/history` — time-series health data (`?since=1h` or `?count=100`)
  - `GET /health/history/stats` — aggregated health statistics
  - `GET /health/history/probe/:name` — per-probe trend data
  - `GET /sla` — uptime reports for all periods
  - `GET /sla/:period` — uptime report for specific period
  - `GET /traces` — recent recovery traces
  - `GET /traces/:traceId` — full span detail for a trace
- New config section: `[observability]` with `logging`, `healthHistory`, and `tracing` subsections
- Total API endpoints: 26 (was 18)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **L3 Deep Repair** recovery tier between L2 (targeted) and L4 (human escalation)
  - **Network repair**: DNS cache flush, TUN interface reset, default route detection
  - **Process resurrection**: Reinstall gateway binary via `npm install -g openclaw` if missing
  - **Dependency health**: Detect corrupted node_modules, rebuild with `npm install --production`
  - **Safe mode boot**: Start gateway with minimal config (no plugins, default routes) when normal restart fails
  - **Disk cleanup**: Truncate oversized logs, delete rotated log files, clear temp directories
- Recovery cascade now: L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 (was L1 → L2 → L4)
- New recovery events: `L3_ATTEMPT`, `L3_SUCCESS`, `L3_FAILURE`, `L3_NO_MATCH`
- New config options: `l3MaxAttempts`, `l3CooldownMs`, `l3SafeModeArgs`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **REST API server** (`aegis serve`) — 18 JSON endpoints for dashboard integration
  - Health, probes, incidents, recovery, config, alerts, system info
  - CORS enabled, sensitive data auto-scrubbed
  - Zero external dependencies (uses `node:http`)
- **Two-way bot commands** for Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord
  - 8 commands: `/health`, `/status`, `/incidents`, `/recovery`, `/backups`, `/alerts`, `/version`, `/help`
  - Telegram: long polling via `getUpdates` API
  - WhatsApp: webhook server for Meta Cloud API callbacks
  - Slack: slash command endpoint with HMAC signature verification
  - Discord: REST API polling with message commands
  - Reuses existing alert channel credentials
- New `[api]` config section: `enabled`, `port`, `host`
- New `[bot]` config section with per-platform enable flags

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Gateway port is now auto-detected from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` at runtime instead of using a hardcoded default
- Shared `detectGatewayPort()` used by both `aegis init` and config loader — no more mismatched ports

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Config probe no longer requires `gateway.port` in `openclaw.json` — the key is optional in OpenClaw and Aegis already knows the port from its own config

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- macOS: memory probe now uses `ps -o rss=` instead of `/proc` (which doesn't exist on macOS)
- macOS: CPU probe now uses `ps -o %cpu=` instead of `/proc`
- Config probe accepts `port` at top level or nested under `gateway` (fixes false "missing gateway.port" error)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- `aegis incidents` — browse past incident logs with timeline view
- `aegis incidents <id>` — full event timeline for a specific incident
- `--json` and `--last N` options for scripting

### Fixed

- `aegis --version` now reads from `package.json` instead of hardcoded value
