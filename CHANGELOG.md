# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenClaw Aegis are documented here.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Channel readiness probe** — 11th health probe that checks all configured messaging channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) are actually connected and ready to deliver messages via `openclaw channels status --json`
  - Score 2: all channels ready
  - Score 1: some channels degraded (running but not connected)
  - Score 0: no channels running or command failed
- Detects WhatsApp Web listener disconnections, Telegram bot failures, and startup gaps where channels aren't ready yet

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** — exposes health scores, probe results, recovery counts, circuit breaker state, alert stats, MTTR, and process memory in Prometheus text exposition format
- **Structured JSON logging** — JSONL format logs compatible with Loki, ELK, Datadog. Configurable log level, file output, and stdout toggle
- **Health history time-series** — stores every health check result over time (default: 24 hours at 10s intervals). Query by time range or count, compute trend statistics
- **SLA tracking and uptime reports** — calculates uptime percentages, time in each health band, incident counts, and MTTR for any time period (1h/24h/7d/30d presets)
- **Recovery tracing** — records structured spans for every recovery step with timing, compatible with OpenTelemetry JSON format for import into Jaeger/Tempo
- 8 new API endpoints:
  - `GET /metrics` — Prometheus scrape target
  - `GET /health/history` — time-series health data (`?since=1h` or `?count=100`)
  - `GET /health/history/stats` — aggregated health statistics
  - `GET /health/history/probe/:name` — per-probe trend data
  - `GET /sla` — uptime reports for all periods
  - `GET /sla/:period` — uptime report for specific period
  - `GET /traces` — recent recovery traces
  - `GET /traces/:traceId` — full span detail for a trace
- New config section: `[observability]` with `logging`, `healthHistory`, and `tracing` subsections
- Total API endpoints: 26 (was 18)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **L3 Deep Repair** recovery tier between L2 (targeted) and L4 (human escalation)
  - **Network repair**: DNS cache flush, TUN interface reset, default route detection
  - **Process resurrection**: Reinstall gateway binary via `npm install -g openclaw` if missing
  - **Dependency health**: Detect corrupted node_modules, rebuild with `npm install --production`
  - **Safe mode boot**: Start gateway with minimal config (no plugins, default routes) when normal restart fails
  - **Disk cleanup**: Truncate oversized logs, delete rotated log files, clear temp directories
- Recovery cascade now: L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 (was L1 → L2 → L4)
- New recovery events: `L3_ATTEMPT`, `L3_SUCCESS`, `L3_FAILURE`, `L3_NO_MATCH`
- New config options: `l3MaxAttempts`, `l3CooldownMs`, `l3SafeModeArgs`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **REST API server** (`aegis serve`) — 18 JSON endpoints for dashboard integration
  - Health, probes, incidents, recovery, config, alerts, system info
  - CORS enabled, sensitive data auto-scrubbed
  - Zero external dependencies (uses `node:http`)
- **Two-way bot commands** for Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord
  - 8 commands: `/health`, `/status`, `/incidents`, `/recovery`, `/backups`, `/alerts`, `/version`, `/help`
  - Telegram: long polling via `getUpdates` API
  - WhatsApp: webhook server for Meta Cloud API callbacks
  - Slack: slash command endpoint with HMAC signature verification
  - Discord: REST API polling with message commands
  - Reuses existing alert channel credentials
- New `[api]` config section: `enabled`, `port`, `host`
- New `[bot]` config section with per-platform enable flags

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Gateway port is now auto-detected from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` at runtime instead of using a hardcoded default
- Shared `detectGatewayPort()` used by both `aegis init` and config loader — no more mismatched ports

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Config probe no longer requires `gateway.port` in `openclaw.json` — the key is optional in OpenClaw and Aegis already knows the port from its own config

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- macOS: memory probe now uses `ps -o rss=` instead of `/proc` (which doesn't exist on macOS)
- macOS: CPU probe now uses `ps -o %cpu=` instead of `/proc`
- Config probe accepts `port` at top level or nested under `gateway` (fixes false "missing gateway.port" error)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- `aegis incidents` — browse past incident logs with timeline view
- `aegis incidents <id>` — full event timeline for a specific incident
- `--json` and `--last N` options for scripting

### Fixed

- `aegis --version` now reads from `package.json` instead of hardcoded value

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Discord** alert provider — rich embeds with color-coded severity
- **Email (SMTP)** alert provider — STARTTLS and direct TLS support
- **Pushover** alert provider — push notifications with priority mapping
- **Slack** alert provider — Incoming Webhooks with mrkdwn formatting

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Health Monitor** with 10 probes: process, port, HTTP, config, WebSocket, TUN/network, memory, CPU, disk, log tail
- **Health scoring** with configurable bands (HEALTHY/DEGRADED/CRITICAL) and weighted probe scores
- **PID resolution** via systemd (`systemctl --user show`) with PID file fallback
- **Config Guardian** with dead man's switch — auto-rollback on bad config changes within 30s
- **Config-write storm protection** — detects rapid config changes and prevents overlapping recovery
- **Pre-flight validation** — blocks restart if config is invalid, missing required keys, or contains poison keys
- **Recovery Orchestrator** with 4-tier cascade:
  - L1: Quick restart with exponential backoff (5s/15s/45s, 3 attempts)
  - L2: Targeted repair via 6 failure pattern matchers
  - L4: Human alert with full incident timeline
- **Diagnosis Engine** matching 6 failure patterns:
  - Runtime config injection (poison keys)
  - Stale PID file
  - Port conflict
  - File permission error
  - Config corruption
  - OOM kill
- **Anti-flap protection** — sliding window crash counter, cooldown, decay
- **Circuit breaker** — stops auto-recovery after 3 failed escalation cycles in 1 hour
- **Backup Manager** with two-tier system:
  - Chronological snapshots (last 20)
  - Known-good configs promoted after 60s stability (last 5)
  - Atomic writes with SHA-256 integrity verification
- **Alert Dispatcher** with 8 out-of-band providers:
  - ntfy (push notifications)
  - Telegram (Bot API with MarkdownV2)
  - WhatsApp (Business Cloud API)
  - Slack (Incoming Webhooks with mrkdwn)
  - Discord (Webhooks with rich embeds, color-coded)
  - Email (SMTP with STARTTLS/TLS)
  - Pushover (push notifications with priority mapping)
  - Webhook (HTTP POST with HMAC-SHA256 signing)
- **Sensitive data scrubbing** on all outbound alerts
- **Alert retry** with configurable exponential backoff
- **Incident Logger** with append-only JSONL event logs and MTTR tracking
- **CLI commands**:
  - `aegis init` — interactive setup wizard with `--auto` mode
  - `aegis check` — one-shot health check with `--json` output
  - `aegis status` — color-coded health dashboard
  - `aegis test-alert` — send test notifications to all channels
- **Platform adapters** for systemd (Linux) and launchd (macOS)
- **TOML configuration** with full schema validation (Zod)
- **Path expansion** — `~` resolved at config load time

### Infrastructure
